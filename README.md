## Overview

I've learned HTML & CSS for two months and now I'm practicing them. this is my first project on the web. I like working with Flexbox & Grid and in this project I tried to use Flexbox for organizing the main card in the middle of viewport and other components inside the main card. hope it works well.

## My process

First of all I wrote html tags. I divided the body into two 'div'. One of them was the main card with qr-code and related texts. The other one was the footer. I used Flexbox for organizing the card in the middle of viewport then centering the qr-code and related text in the middle of the main card.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

One of my major learnings while working through this project was set body height to center all of components in the middle of screen vertically.
```css
body {
  height: 100vh;
}
```

### Continued development

I'm a beginner in front-end. I want to work with html & css for a while.

### Useful resources
